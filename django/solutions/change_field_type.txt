Django 1.7 You can use the AlterField operation to change the column. First, create an empty migration:

>>> python manage.py makemigrations --empty my_app
Then, add the following operation:

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    operations = [
        migrations.AlterField('some_model', 'id', models.CharField(max_length=255))
    ]
Now run the migration, and Django will alter the field to match the new CharField.


AND RENAME IN MODEL FILE
