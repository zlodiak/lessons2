A few years ago, I felt like I was ____stucked__________. So I decided to follow in the _____footsteps_________of the great
American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock and try something new for 30 days. Think about something you're
always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.

There's a few things I learned while doing these 30 day ____challenges__________. The first was instead of the months
flying by, forgotten the time was much more ____memoriable__________. That was part of a challenge I did to take a
picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day.
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30 day challenges, my _____self confidence_________ grew. I went
from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work for fun.

I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30 day challenges. I also _____figured_________ that
if you really want something badly enough you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a
novel? Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000 word novel from
_____scratch_________ in 30 days. Now is my book next great American novel? No, I wrote it in a month. It's
_____awful_________.

There is nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. _______in fach_______there are a ton of fun. But they're less
likely to stick. When I _______give up_______sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this. So here's my question to
you. "What are you waiting for?"

I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not. So why not think about
something you have always wanted to try and ______give it a shot________ for the next 30 days
