i want to tell about film that called gladiator
it tells story about warrior who served the mark avrelius
this warrior ran away, when mark aurelius was killed by his son 
finally he became gladiator and died at the battle arena

this film belongs to the neo peplum genre
there were three waves of peplums popularity
first peplum films appeared at the beginning of the last century.
it was first wave of peplums popularity.
in that time were created such classical films as: cabiria, intolerance, quo vadis
in the fifties of the last century, the second wave of peplums popularity started
it lasted about ten years
the most famous films were: spartakus, ben-gur, three hundred spartans, kleopatra.
the third wave of peplums popularity stared twenty years ago. 
it started after appeared modern films such as gladiator, troy, and so on
now third wave of peplums has reduced

in most cases peplums base on historical stories from ancient times and from bible
the big battles are important part of these films
of course budgets of peplums is huge
the gladiator film has all these properties
