if i dont have a project i usually fall asleep again
it lasts about one hour
after awakening i start reading the news

2:
actually my work activity begins at 12 am
it is important to launch all messengers because company uses them for communication.
i do it.
for now i have a choice
first, i can join an inner project
second i can continue to study technologies.
i prefer the second way

I train several times a week

i jog there for about thirty minutes.
sometimes i do strength exercises instead of jogging
during a summer i usually walk around the city
in most cases my walking lasts about three hours
some of my colleagues think it is too long

4:
sometimes i watch movies
i usually do it at the end of the day
i use movies to reduce stress
I feel relaxed after watching the movie
in other words, I become calm
sometimes i watch movies in the middle of a day
in most cases it happens on weekends
i cant watch movies during my workday because i loose concentration

I try not to do work on weekends
these days i wake up late
after awakening i eat then i rest again
after a while i go to workout
i often play computer games in the evening

i think it is a good idea to watch a new movie every weekend
i do it at night
