persona

i watched a lot of various movies during my life.
some of them i like more that others.
the first serious film I saw was called Heaven over Berlin.
this film tells the story of two angels who travel among people.
it was adviced to me by user of local forum about thirteen years ago.
since then i started to watch movies a lot.

the second significant film was Andrey rublev.
i watched it several times.
although i didnt understand it at that time entirely.
nevertheless i adviced it to my friends sometimes.
i hope they were grateful to me.
i know that Soljenicin didnt like this film.
he found a lot of historical mistakes.
however this film is about human senses but not about history.

i very respect any Bresson films.
but i really only love a few of them.
first of all this is Mushett.
this movie was filmed in a minimal manner.
the director did not approve of acting at all.
that's why all the actors were natural.

sometimes i watch trash films.
one of the best trash films is the green elephant.
first of all it is a very brave movie.
only 4 actors participate in it.
besides, the operator only used an amateur camera.
this film contains many obscene expressions.
almost everyone died at the end of this film.

there are films that are based on literary source.
one of them is dyadya vanya by andrey konchalovsky.
this film is based on a play by anton chehov.
it has a unique atmosphere of a Russian estate.
there were a lot of problems between tenants of this estate.
however, no one dies as a result.

also i like a comedies.
although i like a comedies of the soviet union mostly, but sometimes i watch american comedies.
for example i once saw a few films of woody allen.
the most memorable of them was Manhattan.
its events took place in new york.
two people collided there.
this is a bit of a sad movie because they broke up in the end
