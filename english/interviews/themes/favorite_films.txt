i watched a lot of various movies during my life.
some of them i like more that others.
the first serious film I saw was called Heaven over Berlin.
this film tells the story of two angels who travel among people.
this film was adviced to me by user of forum aboutthirteen years ago.
since then i started to watch movies a lot.

the second significant film was Andrey rublev.
i wathed it several times.
although i didnt understand it at that time entirely.
nevertheless i adviced it to my friends sometimes.
i hope they were grateful to me.
i know that Soljenicin didnt like this film.
he found a lot of historical mistakes.
however this film is about human senses but not about history.

i very respect any Bresson films.
but i really only love a few of them.
first of all this is Mushett.
this film was filmed in a minimal manner.
the director did not approve of acting at all.
that's why all the actors were natural.
