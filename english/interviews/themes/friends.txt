when i was in high school i had a lot of friends.
first of all i would like to discribe Konstantin.
he was my classmate
we sat at the same table
at first he was tall and skinny, but he became more muscular over time
it is because he started to train hard
he had some problems with his facial skin
he was smarter than me so he got hogh grades mostly
we friquently played volleybal together
I played computer games for the first time at his house

sometimes we visited a flat of Valera
valera was pretty fat boy
his parents were important people
they often helped to out school
all classmated and teachers respected valera
one day he asked me to help him with computer ducation classes
i agreed of course
but other classmates joked with us during the lesson
it was terrible

when i entered university i started attending the internet 
there i met vlad, he was a designer
he had black long hair and pointed nose
his weight was a little overweight
we playd misic together, in other words we participated in the same rock band
vlad enjoy painting
once he introduced me to the painting of Pieter Bruegel
since then I started to be interested in painting
Vlad also knew how to draw. in other words he also had the ability to draw
when vlad graduated from the university he went to moscow
there he became a professional designer

Alexey is another musician I knew
he studied at the physics faculity
he also played in a rock band
his band was called Sound defect
when he graduated from the university he started working for a television company
after a while he met a girl
he fell in love with her
at that time we often gathered to drink beer and attend rock concerts
two years later, Alexey and his girlfriend got married
it was an exciting event for them
after a while his wife gave birth to a child
unforntunately alexey and olga divorced
alexey was depressed
I recently found out that he died

now i work for simbirsoft company
a lot of my colleagues are interesting people
for instance i would like to tell about alex
he used to be just a developer
but now he is the head of the department

nevertheless he is a smart employee
besides he likes physical activity

he recently bought a separate apartment

i used to play in a rock band called bastion
Vova was part of this group for some time
although he was a weak guitarist, we were friends
now he also works for simbirsoft
but our relationship collapsed
maybe it happened because he did not understand my jokes
he started to go bald a few years ago
he had a car, sometimes he drives me
vova is an analyst
before his brother also worked in our company
but he was fired about half year ago
he has a kind person and a good driver
