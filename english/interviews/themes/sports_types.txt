i enjoy sports and any physical activity.
when i was in high school i played voleyball a little.
in that time we didnt have appropriate field so we played in the school garden.
i also liked soccer but i rarely play it.
as you know the footbal field is too large.
nevertheles i was good as a goalkeeper.

when i graduated from the highschool i started jogging a little.
i prefered to jog in the forest.
in some cases i did it with my friend.
additionally i joged in university physical education classes weekly.

there was a period in which i didnt do any sports.
it is because i actively played drums and drank alcoholic beverages.
after a while my friends advised me to visit a gym.
i agreed.
the guitarist of my rock band visited the same gym.
he showed me some exercises.
after that i continued my trainings alone.
i changed a gym soon because i met a new instructor.
he was a drummer just like me.
that is why he offered to visit his gym for free.
i had about three workouts a week.

one day i decided to do yoga.
i wanted to restore my mental health and meet new friends.
as a result i signed up for a yoga studio.
i visited it for two years.
then i contined my exercises at home.
sometimes i used my rehearsal base.
it lasted three years.

once i decided to give up yoga.
i started jogging again instead of yoga.
i wanted to train my heart.
for three years i joged constantly.
at the moment my stamina has increased.
sometimes i dream of a maraphon.
but i am affraid of injury.

I ride bicycle several times during the summer.
to do it i rent this type of vehicle.
this rent is cheap.
i prefer to ride in the countryside with my colleagues.
maybe i will buy my own bike soon.
