i am gonna describe a pretty original movie 
it is called cloud paradise
in russian it is pronounced like a облако рай
this movie belongs to the comedy genre
it tells story that lasts one day

a certain guy lived far from big cities and the civilization at all
his name was Kolya
one morging kolya wanted to talk to someone
but population of his town was serious and gloomy.
it didnt want to talk
so kolya cheated on his friend, in other words he become a cheater

kolya told his friend about travel plans
but his friend believed kolya
he did it because his existence was boring
friend started to help kolya
in particular he told his neighbors about travel plans
after that these neighbors began to prepare kolya for the travel

along the way kolya really decided to leave his town
finally he got on the local bus and ran away from his neighbors
Kolya's story is similar to the story of modern jesus christ in a smaller format

the director of this film made the second part
in other words there is the continue of this film
in my opinion it is not interesting
i tried to watch it once but i turned it off after twenty minutes
although the same actors plays the main role 








would like to be the first today
who will be the first today
i will be the first today if you don't mind
I suggest listening to the next story
