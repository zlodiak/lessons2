i was very busy today.
i also was busy last weeks in general
every day i do the same things
it means i write a code and communicate with various managers
since my important project lasts for 3 months i couldnt spend time for english

a long time ago there was a preriod when i was relatively free for several months
at that time I did not have any project
it was a great time
but at the moment i try to do only programming

overall now i have something like the shame because i gave up my englisg classes.
as a result my english skills have decreased.
but i hope to continue english activity because a i plan to get a foreign project soon

i used to listen to english podcasts using clamp audio player in transport
however this player was broken very quickly 
fortunately it was very cheap
it costs about 2 hundred fifty roubles
thats why i didnt try to return my money using the guarantee
