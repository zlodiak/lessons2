i was very busy today and last weeks in general
every day i do the same thing
i mean the writing a code
since my important project lasts for 2 months i cant spend time for english

there was a preriod when i was relatively free for several months
at that time I did not have a project
but at the moment I am trying to do only programming

i used to listened to english podcasts using clamp audio player in transport
however this player was broken after 
fortunately it was very cheap
it costs about 2 hundred fifty roubles
thats why i didnt try to return my money using the guarantee

I spent the last weekend at home
it was a tense time because i was finishing my project tasks
i visited the forest couple times
there i jogged and did strength exercises
