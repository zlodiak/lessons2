Captains daughter.

My father had served for lord Minih and had retired in 17.. Then he lived in his Simbirsk village. There father was married. Wife was called Avdotya Vasilyevna, she was poor gentleman daughter. Our family consisted of nine children. All my brothers and sisters had died.

Before my birth i was enrolled to Semyonovski regiment. To do this a close relative has provided assistance. If girl will be born, then my father will make a declaration about soldier death. He decided that way. Army authorities considered me as a vacation.

Nowadays education rules have changed. After fifth birthday a was given to Savyeliych. He was my mentor because he didnt drink wine and has stableman profession. With his help i learned to read and to write. At that time i was eleven years old.

After that my father hired monsieur Bopreu, who was french. Monsieur had lived in Moscow, then had come to our village. He brought annual stock wine and olive oil. But Savyeliych grumbled, he didnt like the monsieur Bopreu coming. Savyeliych thought no need to spend money.
