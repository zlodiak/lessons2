i would like to talk about people, who inspire my. (инспАя)
but it is a difficult task (дИфикульт)
unfortunately outstanding people such as steve jobs, mark zukerberg or linus torvalds are ordinary enginers (Ордаинри энжинЕЕс)
only those people can inspire who left a mark on art
for example it is dostoewsky or ingmar bergman.
i will tell about ingmar bergman.
this is a swedish film director(свИдиш).
he made more than fiveteen movies(фАйфтиин). 
his every movie is different from the previous one.
I think it is very important don't stop there(ТЕе) (not to stop developing).
it is also very important in information technologies. (Олсе)
now i know javascript-language, but i learn python-language.
next month i will change direction in out company(мОнт).
i was inspired by bergman.


he creates the best films in fifties and sixties years last century.
movies as the person, seventh seal, the shame become world classics.
