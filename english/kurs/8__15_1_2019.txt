good morning, dear colleagues. 
tell about strong qualities at the interview is plaesantly. 
but i would like start interview with weak qualities.
i has few weak qualities, but they are serious.
always i try do homework in the morning.
it is good idea, but i like sleep. 
therefore i am often ignore own tasks.
the second weak quality is laziness.
when i collide with monotone tasks, i lose desire to do this task.
but in result i get more creative tasks.
i think that have ability choose tasks it is most important strong quality.
any it-organisation need creative employees primarily.
thanks for attention.
