if I work in placeholder company, I will strive to develop as a technical specialist. (спЕшалист)
I am not interested in management.
because over time a manager loose technical skills.
it happens because technologies are developing very quickly.
but anyway i will do my work well.
after two years i plan grow to the level middle-developer.
after that I will most likely develop in the direction of machine learning.
If new technologies appear in the IT-world, I will choose them.
because obsolete professions are automated and people become unnecessary. (Обсолейт, Аннессессари)
finally in 2024 i would like to be a senior-developer.
