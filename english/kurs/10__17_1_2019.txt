good evening.
in the last interview i told about my weak qualities. 
now i will tell about strong qualities.
firstly i am very punctual. (пЭнктуэл)
always i prefer come earlier to place and wait near the entrance.
i do that in any situations, such as interviewing or daily office visit.
when i might be late, i always ordered taxi.
the second quality, which i can be proud is accuracy. (Акурэйси)
usually, i write code, which can be works years later. (иЕеас лэйте)
this is especially important in the team development. (еспЕшли)
lastly I want to tell about the code base of the project, which i get from prevous developer. (прИвиэс)
this code was written badly, but it works.
the customer asked to make changes. (Ааскт)
in result i have spent a lot of time for a small feature. (фиЧее)
the prevous developer was not accuracy. (вэз нОт)
that is all i wanted to tell today.
